title: "Ideas and Proposals"
---

We are currently gathering ideas and proposals for R Project Sprint 2023.

Projects should be related to code or documentation maintained by the R Core Team. Priority will be given to projects that have the support of R Core either directly (an R Core member has authored a proposal or commented in favour) or indirectly (the project follows established pathways of contributing to R bugs or translations).

## Ideas

Project **ideas** may be suggested by anyone with an interest in R development.

An **idea** may be

-   A concept that could be turned into a **project proposal**.
-   A small task that could be
    -   combined with other ideas to form a **project proposal**, or
    -   picked up by a sprint participant if they have spare time alongside a larger project.

Suggest an **idea** by opening a thread in the [ideas](https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/discussions/categories/ideas) category of Discussions in the [r-project-sprint-2023](https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023) GitHub repository.

## Proposals

Project **proposals** must be created by a [sprint participant](/participants), potentially in collaboration with external contributors.

A project **proposal** should outline a specific package of work where good progress could be made by 2-6 people in Â½ to 3 days.

For example:

-   Addressing a set of related bugs reported on [R's Bugzilla](https://bugs.r-project.org/).
-   Implementing a given solution to address "TODO" or "FIXME" comments in the R sources.
-   Making specific improvements to contributor infrastructure, such the [Weblate server](https://translate.rx.studio/).

Sprint participants can add a project proposal as follows:

1.  Clone the [r-project-sprint-2023](https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023) repository.
2.  Within `/projects`, copy the `template` directory and name the copy in kebab case with a suitable short name (e.g. `short-project-name`).
3.  In the new directory, edit the `index.Rmd` file. Preview locally by rendering the Quarto website or knitting the R markdown file.
4.  Commit the `.Rmd`. The website is updated automatically by GitHub actions.
5.  When your project page page is live, add a reaction above the comment box at the bottom - this will open a thread in the [proposals](https://github.com/r-devel/r-project-sprint-2023/discussions/categories/proposals) category of `r-project-sprint-2023` Discussions.
6.  \[Optional\] Add labels to the discussion thread with the categories you added to your proposal.

Note this assumes you accepted your invitation to the R-devel GitHub organization - please contact [r-project-sprint\@livewarwickac.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:r-project-sprint@livewarwickac.onmicrosoft.com) if you have any issues.
