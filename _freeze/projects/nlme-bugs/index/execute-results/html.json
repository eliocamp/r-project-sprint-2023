In some cases there is already a patch or a proposed solution. Other cases require some discussion or further debugging to determine an appropriate solution. Often only the R code is affected and the problem is more about determining the correct behaviour rather than debugging low-level code, though that will be required in the hardest cases.\n\nThis project would suit a group of people working in twos or threes, with each small group aiming to close one or two bugs during the sprint.\n\nThe **nlme** package is version controlled in a Subversion repository, available at <https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/nlme/>.\n\n## Problem statement\n\nThe list of **nlme** bugs on [R's Bugzilla](https://bugs.r-project.org/) as of 23 June 2023 is summarised below:\n\n| Bug ID                                                    | Level        | Status                     | Topic                                                           |

In more detail:\n\n-   **check patch**\n\n    -   Check the bug is still present in the development version of **nlme**.\n\n    -   Apply the patch to the **nlme** sources, build and install the package, and test a reprex to confirm the patch fixes the issue.\n\n    -   Run R CMD check on the built package to check nothing is broken by the change.\n\n-   **update doc**\n\n    -   Modify the source of the documentation file in the **nlme** sources.\n\n    -   Review your changes (e.g. Preview in RStudio or build and install to view).\n\n    -   Create a patch to include both code and documentation changes.\n\n-   **create reprex**\n\n    -   Create a minimal, reproducible example, using only base R packages plus **nlme**, that demonstrates the issue. In complex cases, this may require creating a Docker image so that the whole environment is reproducible.\n\n-   **discuss**\n\n    -   Discuss what the appropriate behaviour of the code should be, or discuss a proposal to clarify the way forward. Summarize conclusions on Bugzilla or agree a way forward with a member of R Core.\n\n-   **debug**\n\n    -   Identify the parts of the code that are the root cause of the issue. This may not always be code that triggers an error, but code that does not produce the correct result in particular circumstances.\n\n-   **create patch**\n\n    -   Modify the R and/or C source code to implement a proposed change. This can involve substantial work to determine the appropriate changes to make and may be an iterative process with feedback from others.\n\n## Testing\n\nIn general, we will rely on the tests included in the **nlme** package. It may be appropriate to propose additions to this test suite to cover the code added/modified when addressing a bug report.\n\nWe may also run reverse dependency checks to check changes do not break packages that depend on **nlme**.\n\n## Project requirements\n\nFamiliarity with Subversion will be helpful, however note that you can create a RStudio package project from the repository URL: <https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/nlme/>.\n\nFamiliarity with R package development will be helpful, though again RStudio makes it simple to run R CMD check on the package or to build and install from source. Note that documentation in **nlme** is written directly in `.Rd` format.\n\nOn MacOS you should have the [mandatory development tools](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/), Xcode and GNU Fortran installed.\n\nOn Windows you should have [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools43/rtools.html) installed.\n\n## Project resources\n\n* [Writing R documentation files](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Writing-R-documentation-files)\n\n* [Mixed-Effects Models in S and S-PLUS](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b98882), José C. Pinheiro and Douglas M. Bates - we will have at least one copy of this book available at the sprint.\n\n## Project outcomes\n\nContribution to a recommended package (potentially acknowledged in the ChangeLog).\n\nExperience with the package development process.\n\nExperience with creating/applying patches with Subversion.\n\nExperiences working with bug reports on Bugzilla.\n\n## Reactions and comments\n\n\n```{=html}\n<!-- \nPlease leave the Reactions and comments section\n- a Giscus comment box will be automatically added here \n-->\n```\n",
